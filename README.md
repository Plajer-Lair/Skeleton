# Skeleton - Minigame skeleton project
Skeleton is a Maven project prepared to be a base for creating minigames.

Skeleton does contain:
* Base code structure you would like to have when creating a minigame
* Prepared maven configuration with dependencies and build setup
  * These dependencies were set for mine own development purposes so you might use totally different ones there
* Few simple tests for, mostly basic, POJO's
* Default resource files

**Fork it yourself and edit for your needs to have a nice skeleton for your next projects**
